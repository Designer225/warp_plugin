 # civics
 civic_warp_ftl_theory:0 "Warp FTL Theory"
 civic_warp_ftl_theory_desc:0 "In the decades prior, the scientific community has been pursuing the promise of breaking the light barrier via warp travel. Though the discovery of hyperlanes and a means of exploiting them offered the allure of speed unmatched even by the most optimistic estimates of warp travel, we strived not to stray from our path unless absolutely necessary."
 civic_warp_ftl_theory_effects:0 "Significantly §Yincreased§! chance to receive research options for warp drives. In addition, AI empires with this civic will §Yfavor§! warp drives over hyperdrives.\nThis option §Hdoes not block off§! hyperdrives; both options will exist simultaneously, unless starting with §HEager Explorers§! or an equivalent civic; even then, the latter will remain a researchable option."

 warp_plugin.0.name:0 "Warp Drives Activated"
 warp_plugin.0.desc:0 "Thank you for installing §YWarp Drives§!!\n\nCurrently, you don't have the §HWarp FTL Theory§! civic. Do you want to add it now? This will make your country prefer warp drives in weight calculations."
 warp_plugin.0.desc.civic:0 "Thank you for installing §YWarp Drives§!!\n\nSince you have the §HWarp FTL Theory§! civic, no action is necessary. Happy warp travelling!"
 warp_plugin.0.a:0 "To parts unknown!"

 colony.3022.default:0 "The Warp Drive? We travel by Hyperlanes!"
 colony.3022.warp:0 "We travel by Warp Drives, too! We are aware of Hyperlanes, but..."
 colony.3023.desc.default:0 "Hyperlanes? Perhaps discovering different types of FTL travel was the divergence point between our two universes? Does this mean you are not beset by the Warp beasts?"
 colony.3023.desc.warp:0 "You, too? May we take a look at your Warp Drive schematics? And are you beset by the Warp Beasts?"
 colony.3023.a.default:0 "No Warp beasts here. Are they a serious threat?"
 colony.3023.a.warp:0 "Hero you go. And no Warp beasts here. Are they a serious threat?"
 colony.3024.desc.default:0 "The Warp beasts assail every known civilization, they are a threat to all life. As far as we have determined, once Warp travel reached a certain critical level in the galaxy, the Warp beasts awoke and attacked. Several species we know of have already fallen, but so far we are holding them off."
 colony.3024.desc.warp:0 "Interesting... the designs are quite similar, but with one exception: on paper, your Warp drives rival our designs in speed, yet do not appear to breach another dimension. Provided no one else has the bright idea that we once had, your dimension should be safe from Warp beast incursions.\n\nAs we both know, Warp drives by themselves are quite slow. In our dimension, we attempted to rectify it by briefly entering and exiting another dimension, achieving great speeds as a result. At the time, we herald it as a great leap for interstellar travel.\n\nBut as Warp travel reached a certain critical level in the galaxy, unknown beings now known as the Warp beasts emerged and attacked.\n\nAt the time, we attributed it as an inevitability. But this fortuitous occurrence - though admittedly under less-than-fortuitous circumstances - suggested instead that we have awoken the Warp beasts from their slumber within their dimension, and they lashed out by breaching into ours. \n\nThe Warp beasts have proven themselves to be a threat to all life, and have assailed every known civilization. Several species we know of have already fallen, but so far we are holding them off."

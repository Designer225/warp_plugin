 # events
 warp_plugin.1.name:0 "Warp Drives Activated"
 warp_plugin.1.desc:0 "Thank you for installing §YWarp Drives§!!\n\nSince you have the §HWarp FTL Theory§! civic, your ships will prefer equipping §HWarp Drives§! unless they are eclipsed by more advanced FTL tech. Your warp drives have also been enhanced.\n\n$warp_drive_instructions$"
 warp_plugin.1.desc.hyper:0 "Thank you for installing §YWarp Drives§!!\n\nSince you do not have the §HWarp FTL Theory§! civic, your ships will prefer §HHyper Drives§! unless they are eclipsed by more advanced FTL tech. However, you may manually mount §HWarp Drives§! on your ships at any time.\n\n$warp_drive_instructions$"
 warp_drive_instructions:0 "Currently, warp drives work through the §HFTL Jump§! mechanic, but simulates the travel by event-locking the warping fleet until it 'arrives' in the system. You can thus travel unbounded by hyperlanes, but note that if your ship travels to a system you loses access to and it has no direct hyperlane connections to your territory, the Emergency FTL back home §Pmay take significantly longer§!."

 warp_plugin.120.name:0 "Fleet System Overstress"
 warp_plugin.120.desc:0 "Attempting to accelerating the fleet's warp jump has §Poverstressed§! one or more of its ships' systems.\n\nIt will take a month to restore the faulted systems back to full operation."

 colony.3022.default:0 "The Warp Drive? We travel by Hyperlanes!"
 colony.3022.warp:0 "We travel by Warp Drives, too! We are aware of Hyperlanes, but..."
 colony.3023.desc.default:0 "Hyperlanes? Perhaps discovering different types of FTL travel was the divergence point between our two universes? Does this mean you are not beset by the Warp beasts?"
 colony.3023.desc.warp:0 "You, too? May we take a look at your Warp Drive schematics? And are you beset by the Warp Beasts?"
 colony.3023.a.default:0 "No Warp beasts here. Are they a serious threat?"
 colony.3023.a.warp:0 "Hero you go. And no Warp beasts here. Are they a serious threat?"
 colony.3024.desc.default:0 "The Warp beasts assail every known civilization, they are a threat to all life. As far as we have determined, once Warp travel reached a certain critical level in the galaxy, the Warp beasts awoke and attacked. Several species we know of have already fallen, but so far we are holding them off."
 colony.3024.desc.warp:0 "Interesting... the designs are quite similar, but with one exception: on paper, your Warp drives rival our designs in speed, yet do not appear to breach another dimension. Provided no one else has the bright idea that we once had, your dimension should be safe from Warp beast incursions.\n\nAs we both know, Warp drives by themselves are quite slow. In our dimension, we attempted to rectify it by briefly entering and exiting another dimension, achieving great speeds as a result. At the time, we herald it as a great leap for interstellar travel.\n\nBut as Warp travel reached a certain critical level in the galaxy, unknown beings now known as the Warp beasts emerged and attacked.\n\nAt the time, we attributed it as an inevitability. But this fortuitous occurrence - though admittedly under less-than-fortuitous circumstances - suggested instead that we have awoken the Warp beasts from their slumber within their dimension, and they lashed out by breaching into ours. \n\nThe Warp beasts have proven themselves to be a threat to all life, and have assailed every known civilization. Several species we know of have already fallen, but so far we are holding them off."
